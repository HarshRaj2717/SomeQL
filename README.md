# SomeQL

SomeQL (Some Query Language) is a simpler dummy version of an SQL engine written in rust.

> This is a hobby project and obviously meant for "_production_" ;)

This is my first time using rust at anything (I have only written a "hello world" before which was an year ago), so there might be some issues here are there in my implementation that I will be trying to fix over time.

## Archived Info

This repo has been archived as I the project wasn't well planned and I was running into issues than I planned, there were no tests (which for project is imp ig now), also I wanted to build a POC first for testing the performance and functions a bit but I had been placing way more time trying to write a "kinda" compiler here myself instead of something like LLVM.

I will be doing a re-write here, this time with a plan - https://github.com/HarshRaj2717/beachQL (if the link doesn't work then it might still be under work and private, I want to build this one from start to finish myself just for the fun of it, so will be keeping it private till it is at some fine/averagely built level.)
